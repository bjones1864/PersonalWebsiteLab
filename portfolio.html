    <h2>Some Notable Projects</h2>

    <a href="https://github.com/bjones1864/LibraryProject">Library System Software</a>
    <p>This is a C# console app made for my midterm project at Grand Circus Bootcamp.
        It allows a user to check out books and movies from a library, as well as return books and donate books.
        The intent was to show off the use of a class, as well as file input/output.

    <a href="https://github.com/bjones1864/PigLatin">Pig Latin Translator</a>
    <p>This is another C# console app made for Grand Circus Bootcamp. 
        It is a Pig Latin translator, that can translate entire paragraphs with punctuation.
        This shows off some string manipulation, as well as working with arrays
