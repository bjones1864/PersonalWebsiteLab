    <p>Hello world!  I am an aspiring software developer and this is my personal website.
        I am currently attending Grand Circus bootcamp, in the C#.Net program and hope to get a job in software development.
        Please take a look!
    </p>

    <p>I live in the Detroit area, which is also where I grew up.
        I am willing to make the move for the right company, though!
    </p>
